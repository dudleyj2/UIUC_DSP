Keeley McManus&nbsp;</b><em>Senior Vice President</em></span></span>

<div><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">My name is Keeley McManus, and I am humbled to be serving as the Senior Vice President for this Spring 2019 semester. I truly cannot&nbsp;imagine&nbsp;a better way to give back to this wonderful organization than being responsible for orchestrating this semester&rsquo;s rush. One of the things that I love most about this fraternity is our strong brotherhood and I am so excited to demonstrate what it means to be a brother of Delta Sigma Pi during this rush semester</span></span><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">.</span></span>
    <br /> &nbsp;

<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Our three pillars of Professionalism, Philanthropy, </span></span><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;">and</span></span><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> Brotherhood are at the core of this fraternity, so it is important that our rush process conveys those to potential new brothers. This organization has greatly enhanced my college experience and I cannot wait for a new class of bright and talented Gies students to join in becoming a part of our brotherhood!</span></span>

    <span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Dear Potential New Members,</strong><br />
<br />
As this semester&rsquo;s Pledge Educators, Julia and I could not be more eager to help introduce new initiates into Delta Sigma Pi. We have both recognized the endless benefits of being members of this organization and want to be able to give it back to incoming students. This semester we have a lot planned, including mock interviews,&nbsp;BBQ&rsquo;s, a&nbsp;pledge class retreat, a case competition,&nbsp;and senior mentors who will be able to help pledges with anything professional. Really looking forward to what&rsquo;s to come!<br />
<br />
