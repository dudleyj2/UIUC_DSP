                    <p class="leadership-bio">My name is Keeley McManus, and I am humbled to be serving as the Senior Vice President for this Spring 2019 semester. I truly cannot imagine a better way to give back to this wonderful organization than being responsible for orchestrating this semesterâ€™s rush. One of the things that I love most about this fraternity is our strong brotherhood and I am so excited to demonstrate what it means to be a brother of Delta Sigma Pi during this rush semester. 
                                              <br><br>
                                              Our three pillars of Professionalism, Philanthropy, and Brotherhood are at the core of this fraternity, so it is important that our rush process conveys those to potential new brothers. This organization has greatly enhanced my college experience and I cannot wait for a new class of bright and talented Gies students to join in becoming a part of our brotherhood!

        <p>The first part is a professional night where you will be involved in short interviews with approximately 2-3 brothers in Delta Sigma Pi.

        <p>The second mandatory part of rush is our social night. During this night, you will have more freedom to talk openly about whatever it is you are interested in. We will be assessing your ability to hold a casual conversation, and we are evaluating if you will be a good social fit in Delta Sigma Pi. This is an opportunity to ask current Deltasigs about the various social events and activities we host during the semester.

    <p>Dear Potential New Members,
    <br>
    <br>
    As this semester&rsquo;s Pledge Educators, Julia and I could not be more eager to help introduce new initiates into Delta Sigma Pi. We have both recognized the endless benefits of being members of this organization and want to be able to give it back to incoming students. This semester we have a lot planned, including mock interviews,&nbsp;BBQ&rsquo;s, a&nbsp;pledge class retreat, a case competition,&nbsp;and senior mentors who will be able to help pledges with anything professional. Really looking forward to what&rsquo;s to come!
    <br>
