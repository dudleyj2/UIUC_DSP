                    <p class="leadership-bio">In&nbsp;Delta Sigma Pi, our members build lifelong relationships with each other in&nbsp;both professional and social settings. We look to make connections that last far beyond college by taking on a number of social events together including Biz Bowl, Business Olympics, Barn Dance, and Formal. In the past year, our brothers have gone on some unforgettable trips together, which helped further strengthen the friendships in Delta Sigma Pi. This Winter, a group of over 30 brothers went on a week-long ski trip in Breckenrigde, Colorado. Last Spring Break, some brothers traveled to Siesta Key, Florida for the week. Just this past summer, a group of DSig alumni explored Asia together on a three-week vacation. Delta Sigma Pi doesn&#39;t just create college friendships; it fosters lifelong friendships.</p>
